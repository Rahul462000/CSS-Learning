    <!-- there are four types of css positioning -->
    <!-- 1. Static -->
    <!-- 2. Relative -->
    <!-- 3. Absolute -->
    <!-- 4. Fixed -->

    <!-- 1.Static position means it is static to, it's original postion means we cannot move it from top down left right -->
    <!-- 2.Realtive postion means it is relative to the original postion of the element and we can move the element from left right top bottom -->
    <!-- 3.absolute postioning means postion to nearest postioned ancestor or top left corner of webpage & also it moves with the webpage if we scroll up it moves up and scroll down it moves down
     eg. if a div have postion relative and it also have an div inside(descendend), then it will have position absolute or if doesn't have a ancestor element it will relative to top corner of the webpage -->
    <!-- 4.fixed positioning it is relative to top left corner of browser window means if we want to scroll the page the position of the element will remain fixed and cannot be moved from it's original position & it moves with the web browser  -->


    <!-- the Z index in css positioning the higher order value will be at the top to another lower order value  -->
    <!-- Z index also have negative value which will make the element go behind the element -->
